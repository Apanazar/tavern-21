# Tavern 21
### Developed on `Pygame`, transitioning to `Godot`

**Tavern 21** is an engaging card game set in the ambient environment of a cozy tavern. Players compete in a game closely resembling blackjack, where the aim is to assemble a hand with a points total nearest to 21 without exceeding it. Winning rounds not only brings the thrill of victory but also unravels exciting erotic stories which players collect in their magazine.
